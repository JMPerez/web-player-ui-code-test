# Web Music Player

This is a small project that I created in April 2012 as a code test, consisting of creating a semi-functional web-based Music Player interface using HTML5 and JavaScript.

The interface serves three purposes:
1. Perform track/artist/album searches through Spotify Metadata API
2. Maintain playlists
	a. CRUD (Create, Remove, Update, Delete)
	b. Add/remove tracks
3. Maintain a current queue of songs
4. Player controls
	a. Play - Hint: “Play” songs using setTimeout for the song length
	b. Stop
	c. Rewind
	d. FastForward

## How to Run

Just open `index.html`. There is extra information about how to run it in the *About* page.
