# Web Music Player

This is a small project that I created in April 2012 as a code test when joining Spotify, consisting of creating a semi-functional web-based Music Player interface using HTML5 and JavaScript.

The interface serves three purposes:

1. Perform track/artist/album searches through Spotify Metadata API
2. Maintain playlists
  - CRUD (Create, Remove, Update, Delete)
  - Add/remove tracks
3. Maintain a current queue of songs
4. Player controls
  - Play - “Play” songs using setTimeout for the song length
  - Stop
  - Rewind
  - FastForward

Note that this is only a UI and there is no music playback.

## How to Run

Just open `index.html`. There is extra information about how to run it in the *About* page.
